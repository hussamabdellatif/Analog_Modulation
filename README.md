# Analog_Modulation
Code to simulate the behavior of Additative White Gaussian Noise in an analog LTI Channel. AWGN has zero mean, and variance of N0/2 with a power spectral density of N_0 /2. 

The first part was a simulation of the noise suppression in band limited signals, and the second part is a simulation of nosie in DSB-SC (Double sideband suppressed carrier.)
